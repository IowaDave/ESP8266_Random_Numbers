# ESP8266_Random_Numbers
Generate unpredictable numbers using entropy obtained directly from ESP8266 hardware.

Download the Arduino code directory to your system. Compile and upload it to an ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.

A web article about random numbers and the 8266 accompanies this repository. Here is a link to the article:
